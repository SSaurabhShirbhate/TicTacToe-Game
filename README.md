# Tic Tac Toe

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid with "X" and "O". The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
